# Coursepilot
Coursepilot generates educational content and turns it into easy to navigate full courses with included audio learning so you can listen to your courses.  You can choose to build your course outline and content from your own corpus of data.  Or, you can use content from any website.

When you are done generating the course outline and content for whatever you want to teach or learn, you can deploy the course online in minutes and start creating a catalog of online training courses.

## How Coursepilot works
First you choose a topic or subject area that you are interested in teaching or learning.  For example you might want to learn about "The basics of Artificial Intelligence and why AI matters".

With your topic chosen, Coursepilot will create an outline of lessons for your course.  You can specify how many lessons you want to include.  Coursepilot uses the latest Azure OpenAI Large Language Models to create a course outline.  If you don't like the outline you can modify your prompt and redo it.

Once you have the outline of your course completed, you can have Coursepilot generate the training content for each lesson. This will include the audio for the content.

During the generation of content, Coursepilot will create a docker image of you courses that you can easily deploy as an Azure Web Application.
