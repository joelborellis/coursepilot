      "[CATEGORY:  Challenger Narration] [SOURCEFILE:  The Challenger exporting the model to the core.txt]Chapter 3. The Challenger exporting the model to the core. Challenger is defined by the ability to do three things. Teach Taylor and take control. And to do all of this through the use of constructive tension. These are the pillars of what we call the Challenger selling model. An approach to sales that is based on what challengers do. It's a methodology that we've worked on with companies across a wide range of industries. Companies as diverse as Talecris, Biotherapeutics, PMI, Brinks in the solutions business of Thomson Reuters. To implement within their own sales organizations. It's previous on the notion that with the right training, coaching and sales tools, most reps, even ardent relationship builders can learn to take control of the customer conversation just like a challenger. The challenge you're selling model is simple in theory but complex in practice, and early adopters will attest to that fact. The rest of this book is dedicated to sharing proven best practices, tools and lessons learned to help companies, commercial leaders, managers, and reps implement the Challenger selling model. Before we begin this journey, it makes sense to discuss some of the fundamental principles that underlie the model and that will become themes throughout the course of the book. Principle number one challengers are made, not just born. One of the questions we often hear is whether being a challenger is a question of nature or nurture for sales reps In other words, our challenges born are made. There are a few ways to answer this question. One of the things we know from our research is that every Rep in our study had traces of the Challenger gene. It just wasn't the thing that they majored in. But because we focused our work specifically on skills, attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge. That tells us that with the right tools, training, coaching, and reward and recognition systems, you can likely equip many of your reps who minor in challenging. And maybe even those who just took a few credits in it to act more like challengers when they're in front of the customer. While there are many reps who won't make the transition, there are many, many more who will if you invest the time and energy to get them there. Furthermore, the idea that challengers are born and not made is somewhat irrelevant. Or we might not be able to rewrite their DNA if we are able to modify non Challenger Rep behavior, even temporarily as they face off with customers. In other words, to flex, as one member put it. That effort is likely time well spent. After all, we are aware of any sales leader who's ready to let go of all but a handful of his reps and rehire an entirely new sales force. That is no head of sales who wants to keep his job. Our operating principle with members has been to focus on arming them with the tools and training they need to improve their existing sales force right now. This is a worthy goal, and it's one that the best organizations have shown great success in pursuing. There's ample evidence to suggest that challengers can be made. We've seen it first hand. Our own SC Solutions group has been tremendously successful in helping members build challengers within their own sales organizations. If you're a sales Rep, regardless of whether or not you're a natural challenger, this discussion of the Challenger sales model contains insights that will help boost your personal effectiveness as a salesperson. While your current approach may differ from the Challenger model, don't think of these differences as insurmountable or somehow carved in stone. Understanding that these gaps exist, and more important that you have it in your power to close them, is a critical part of the journey. Principle #2. It's the combination of skills that matters most. One of the key lessons from our work is that's the combination of the challenger attributes, the ability to teach, tailor, take control and do it all while leveraging constructive tension. That sets challengers apart. If you teach without tailoring, you come off as irrelevant. If you tell her but don't teach, you risk sounding like every other supplier. If you take control but offer no value, you risk being simply annoying. Because they skills are most effective when used in combination, we strongly urge our members to avoid the temptation to cherry pick when it comes to rolling out the model. But just as nature, of course, the vacuum. Companies have or duplicative investment. For this reason, we often hear commercial leaders talk about skipping elements of the model given recent initiatives. For instance, some companies wish to focus on only on tailoring and taking control because they recently poured money into designing new sales collateral. While we can't dictate what companies do with the model, we are up front with our feedback around such partial rollouts. Individual elements of the model, when invested in, can deliver performance improvements over the status quo. Before the model, to really work, all elements must be invested in and developed. There are no shortcuts to fully realizing the potential performance gains that the model offers. Principle #3. Challenging is about organizational capability, not just Rep skills. Many organizations assume that the migrations of the Challenger selling model is a question only of improving individual Rep skills. For the model to really work, that isn't habitually not the case. This journey is actually just as much about building organizational capabilities as it is about developing individual skills. Building a teaching capability, which we'll discuss in much more detail in the following chapters, is not something that you just want your individual reps out there figuring out on their own. While it is true that some of your existing challengers can do this quite effectively, an organization that leaves the teaching content up to its individual reps will be pulled in many different directions as refs promise customer solutions to myriad business issues. Including many your company is not equipped to solve. The act of delivering a teaching pitch is a skill, to be sure. But the content of the TG pitch the business issues. You teach customers to value the idea around which you reframe how the customer thinks about their business. Must be scalable and repeatable, and as such it must be created by the organization, and in most organizations, that's the job of marketing. The same can be said for tailoring. While there is a clear role for the individual Rep on the tailoring front, namely recognizing how to modify the teaching message for different individuals across the customer organization. The organization has an important responsibility when it comes to tailoring as well. First. Organizations can leverage business intelligence and research assets to help challengers better tailor their messages to each customer's industry and company contacts. The organization also bears the responsibility for identifying which teaching messages will resonate with which stakeholders. A1 size fits all teaching message is unlikely to be tenable for most suppliers aside from those who sell in a single line of business to a highly homogeneous set of customers. Yet individual customer stakeholder segmentation at this level again. Is just as much an organizational capability as it is an individual skill. If tailoring is half individual or half organizational, the only component of the Challenger model that can truly be called a largely individual skill is taking control. Here's where wrap up skilling will pay significant dividends. In the Chapter 7, we'll explain the best way to drive this behavior into the frontline. However, it is worth noting that even here, the organization has a role to play. Namely, Challenger reps armed with powerful teaching messages produced by their organizations will be in a much better position to take control of the customer conversation. As well, recent SEC research shows that the organization plays an important role in equipping refs to identify and properly engage with the right stakeholders on the customer side. An important part of taking control of the sale. Grateful #4. Building the Challenger sales force is a journey, not an overnight trip. A big mistake we see organizations make and their challenger efforts is assuming that change will happen instantly. Moving to a Challenger model is a commercial transformation, one that early adopters tell us takes time to get right. Precisely because the Challenger model demands changes to both organizational capabilities and to individual Rep behaviors and skills, it's hard work. Ramming through challenger training for reps without also carefully constructing robust teaching pitches for them to deliver, or arming frontline managers to reinforce the right behaviors and skills might yield the small bump in Rep productivity. But two outcomes are practically guaranteed. The performance boosts attained will fall well short of what could have been delivered if done properly. And more likely than not, it'll be perceived as just the training flavor of the month, soon to be forgotten or rejected by most reps. Early adopters attest to the fact that moving to the Challenger selling model is a journey. Those who have been down this path pegged the time to forward option in years, now weeks or months. Indeed, much of the upfront effort will be spent getting your own leadership team on board with the new model. The Challenger model, in other words, isn't a bolt on software update. It's a new operating system for the entire commercial organization. Those looking for a quick win would be well advised to look elsewhere. If you're ready to take your organization on this transformation journey, however, keep listening. The advantages that are accruing to first movers are enormous. The Challenger model offers a new and powerful way out of the solution selling Morass that has had sales organizations across industries and around the world in a vice grip for years. Does the Challenger Selling model work? Soon after we began sharing the findings from our research, we began hearing stories back from our own members about how their reps were employing the principles of the Challenger selling model with customers, often to outstanding effect. Let's look at each of the pillars of the model in turn to give a sense for what it looks like when done well. Teaching for differentiation. The thing that really sets Challenger reps apart is their ability to teach customers something new and valuable about how to compete in their market. Our research on customer loyalty, which we'll discuss in depth in the next chapter, shows that this is the exact behavior that wins customers for the long term. Teaching is all about offering customers unique perspectives on their business and communicating those perspectives with passion and precision in a way that draws the customer into the conversation. These new perspectives apply not only to your products and solutions, but to how the customer can compete more effectively in their market. It's inside they can use to free up operating expenses, penetrate new markets or reduce risk. To see how this teaching approach works in practice, we'll give you a few examples. The first one is from one of our members at an office furniture manufacturer. A senior member of the company's sales leadership team told us this story of a Rep who was struggling to gain traction with the prospective customer. The customer had just built a new headquarters facility and one of their competitors had been selected to furnish the building. The company seemed to have been cut out of the business, but the Rep, a brand new hire, still felt there was an opportunity to gain a foothold in the new building before the company took delivery from their competitor. After some persistence, she landed a meeting with the companies had a real estate facilities. One of the key priorities for this company was to create collaborative spaces where employees could more effectively interact with one another. In looking at the architects designs. The sales Rep was able to tell him, well, we have robust data that indicates that collaboration. Doesn't happen in groups of eight. It happens in twos and threes and when you get to 7 it stops being productive. You may be building the wrong size conference rooms. That's great to know, responded the customer. But the conference rooms have already been billed. What can I do about that now? Leveraging her product knowledge, the Rep explained how they could put up a movable wall down the middle of the conference rooms, creating two rooms that would fit smaller groups of three and four. Then she talked about a product the company offers that will help facilitate collaboration for them. She started from an insight, taught the customer about a problem they didn't know they had, developed interest, and changed the whole direction of the account. Another good example comes from a global pharmaceutical company. Anybody who knows pharma knows about the arms race that the industry's big players have been locked in for years. Too many reps fighting to get FaceTime with too few doctors. In this tough sales environment, this particular company was looking to breakthrough and become the supplier that physicians prefer to spend time with. However, customer survey data clearly indicated that in the eyes of customers, suppliers were indistinguishable from one another. To cut through the noise, the company in question were to arm its reps to teach physicians new insights not about their products, but about how to improve their own effectiveness as medical practitioners. Relying on the company's wealth of knowledge on disease management, their marketing team built a series of patient journeys that reps could share with doctors. These journeys looked at the entire cycle of an illness, from the time symptoms appear to treatment and finally follow up. For a doctor, seeing the full life cycle of an illness can be pretty eye opening. For example, the company knows that patients with a certain illness have an average of 2.5 exacerbations, frequently requiring a trip to the emergency room per year. However, the family physician for these patients might never know that these emergencies occur between visits. As a consequence, they are treating patients for a much less severe medical condition than the patients actually have. Once they learn this new information, they can change the patient's treatment to avoid or substantially reduce these exacerbations, which really improves the quality of patient care the physicians can deliver. This is inside physicians value and it's helped this particular supplier gain access to physicians in a way they never enjoyed before. One last example. In sales these days, there's a lot of discussion about how reps can get ahead of the RFP. This story illustrates how teaching can be used effectively not just to get ahead of an RFP, but to actually reshape an RFP in a given suppliers favor. The story comes from a supplier of Employee Benefit Management Services who was recently informed by a longtime customer that the company had decided to put the contract for the business out to bid in an attempt to save money. Frustrated that this longtime customer was trying to pull them into a price war. The supplier told them that they weren't interested in that kind of partnership with the client, in other words, one based on price. So they told the customer that they would respectfully decline to submit a bid in response to the forthcoming RFP. But not before they made a rather unique gesture. They told the customer that since they weren't going to participate in the bidding process, but did value the long term working relationship they had. They would be happy to help them think through the construction of their RFP to ensure that they were requesting the right things out of their next supplier. Appreciative of the free consulting the Spire was offering, the customer invited them down for the day, where they spent a few hours outlining what should be in their bid. The discussions included advice along the lines of. If any supplier tells you the following three things, they're wrong, and here's why. They say you need these four things you actually don't, and here's why. No matter what. Make sure that your bid includes the following two things, and here's why. If any company tells you those two things aren't necessary, tell them they're wrong, and here's why. They're just trying to get you to buy the thing that they want to sell. But here's what you need to insist on these two key things. The customer found the advice to be hugely valuable as these were points they wouldn't have thought to consider on their own. Once the RFP was billed, the suppliers accounting looked at it, said OK, well that's the big you're going to put out there, then we'd like to participate since it describes exactly the kind of partnership we'd like to have. This last example in particular illustrates why this teaching approach works so well. The content of the reps pitch is carefully linked to the supplier unique capabilities. If guilty of a sales Rep to deliver, this kind of unique insight is arguably the most powerful weapon in the challengers arsenal, and actually the biggest driver of B2B customer loyalty. On Hocus on building this kind of teaching capability in chapters 4 and 5. Tailoring for residents. While teaching is, above all others, the defining attribute of being a challenger. The ability to tailor the teaching message to different types of customers as well as to different individuals within the customer organization. Is what makes the teaching pitch resonate and stick with the custom. Towering relies on the reps knowledge of the specific business priorities of whomever he or she is talking to. The specific outcomes that particular person values most. The results are the hook to deliver for the company and the various economic drivers most likely to deliver those outcomes. If a challenger Rep is sitting across the table from the head of marketing, he understands how to craft his message to resonate with her specific priorities. And if he's meeting with somebody in operations, he knows how to modify the message accordingly. But this isn't just a measure of business acumen. It's a measure of agility, the reps ability to tailor the story to the individual stakeholders, business environment. What specifically do they care about? How is their performance measured? How do they fit into the overall customer organization? An example that demonstrates the power of effective tailoring comes from our member and the business services provider. Two of their reps have been drily working in one account for approximately six months, building rapport with business leaders across the organization, all the while preparing for a big proposal presentation to the company CEO of management team. After multiple meetings and presentations, the reps honed in on what they thought was most needed by the customer, an outsourcing solution that would deliver cost savings to the business. But just a week before they were about to present the CEO and his team, the reps attended their own companies annual sales meeting, which had been focused on building challenger skills across the sales organization. At the session on tailoring, the reps realized they hadn't fully investigated the personal motivations and business objectives of the customers CEO and were potentially unprepared to make their best pitch at the upcoming meeting. So they called the last minute meeting with some of the key stakeholders in the custom organization in order to better understand the personal goals and objectives of the CEO, all in an attempt to see if there was some insight they could bring to the table that would personally appeal to him. What they learned at this meeting proved to be invaluable. They found out that the CEO was extremely focused on poor customer satisfaction scores the company had recently received. And they learned that the CEO himself was a technology junkie. Instead of going into the meeting with the cost savings focus pitch that they had already prepared, they switched gears and focused the conversation instead on ways in which the solution they were proposing not only would cut costs, but at the same time would improve customer satisfaction. And issue resolution response time by leveraging new technologies that the supplier recently developed. What's more, the technology would allow everyone from the CEO down to line managers to get real time visibility into customer service issues and issue resolution response times. The CEO immediately sat up and listened with rapt attention to the sales pitch. What was to be a standard review of a supplier proposal turned into a surprising discussion of one of the CEO's hot button issues. At the end of the presentation, the CEO thanked the reps for setting new light on a persistent business problem and demonstrating capabilities that he didn't realize the supplier even had. While the competition stuck to their standard proposals, this supplier won the business by tailoring their message to what the CEO cared about most. In a time when consensus is more important than ever to get the deal done, it's no surprise that the Rep who wins in this environment is the one who can effectively tailor the message to a wide range of customer stakeholders in order to build that consensus. This is a topic we're going to explore a lot more depth in Chapter 6. Taking control of the sale. The final characteristic that sets Challenger reps apart is their ability to assert and maintain control over the sale. Now, before we go any further, it's important to note that being assertive does not mean being aggressive, or worse still, annoying or abusive. This is all about the refs willingness and ability to stand their ground when the customer pushes back. Challengers assertiveness takes 2 forms. First, challenges are able to assert control over the discussion of pricing and money more generally. The challenge erupt doesn't give in to the request for a 10% discount, but brings the conversation back to the overall solution, pushing for agreement on value rather than price. Second, challengers are also able to challenge customers thinking and pressure customers decision making cycles. Both to reach a decision more quickly as well as to overcome that indecision inertia that can cause deals to stall indefinitely. In fact, if you think about it, if a key to the challenger Rep success is teaching or reframing how the customer sees their world, then the Rep is going to have to be willing to get a little bit scuffed up in the process. Just as you can't be an effective teacher if you're not going to push your students, you can't be an effective challenger if you're not going to push your customers. This approach is so important today with customer risk aversion as high as it is. It's funny. Sales leaders often lament that core performing groups fall into their comfort zone when selling. But arguably, the bigger problem is that customers often fall into their comfort zone when it comes to buying. And that's what the Challenger Rep does. She moves customers out of their comfort zone by showing them their world in a different light. The key, of course, is to do so with control, diplomacy and empathy. As one of our long time members, the former CSO of one of the world's largest chemical manufacturers explains. In practice, asserting control can take many forms. In essence, it means that the sales professional takes the lead in the customer discussion with a specific end in mind. While the entire toolkit for taking control is both large and complex, there are many simple tools that can be applied with power. Discussions over price price increases or requests for price decreases are very high value areas for sales professionals to take control of, he says. When the topic of price comes up, a powerful technique is for the sales professional to shift the discussion for price to value. During the course of such a discussion, it's useful to get the customer to rank the elements of the offering in order of importance. This is something that enables the customer to see the offering in a different light. These new insights are very useful to both the sales professional and to the customer as they think about value. He told us the story of one of his sales reps who was in a situation where he had to let a long time customer know about an upcoming price increase. One that was not only substantial, but also out of sync with where the economy was. None of the customers other suppliers were raising prices, but the raw material for the suppliers product had gone up so much that it dictated the need. At the same time, years before, that same customer had requested that the product be shipped in an expensive, non standard package. Over time, the cost of this package had substantially reduced the profitability of the business for the supplier. During the discussion of the price increase, the sales professional asked the customer to rank the various features of the suppliers offering. The expensive custom packaging didn't rank in the top three. As a consequence, the supplier and the sales professional agreed to a lower price increase and a shift to standard packaging. The change in packaging improved profitability more than the price increase itself. This was a great outcome, he said, using a relatively simple device whose serve control and a price discussion to deliver a win for both parties. A road map for the rest of the book. What's the best path to building Challenger reps? Here is how we'll tackle this question in the following chapters. In chapters four and five, we'll look at the notion of teaching. We'll address the questions of why teaching works and what your Rep should be teaching in the first place, as well as what the content of their teaching pitch should actually look like. Much of this chapter will center on the critical role that the organization in most companies marketing plays in identifying customer worthy insights that lead to a suppliers unique capabilities. In Chapter 6, we'll look at tailoring. We'll take a deep dive into why tailoring is an effective approach in today's sales environment and look at what the best sales organization do to equip the reps to tailor, in other words, to get them to adapt their sales approach and message to specific individuals across the customer organization. A critical part of the tailoring story is the shift we discussed in Chapter One toward consensus buying within a customer organization. We'll spend some time unpacking this trend in more detail in Chapter 6. In Chapter 7, we'll dig deep into the area of taking control and discuss techniques for getting reps to increase their assertiveness without becoming aggressive. As mentioned before, taking control is an easily misunderstood element of the Challenger selling model. Poorly applied, it will do more harm than good. But correctly applied, it can be the difference between a decision and no decision. In a world where the customer status quo is really your worst enemy and customers are so increasingly risk averse. The ability to take control can be a game changer for your sales reps. In Chapter 8, we will look at the critical role of the frontline Sales manager in building challengers across the sales force. Specifically, we'll look at the issue of coaching, something most sales organizations continue to neglect. This is an area of deep expertise for the Sales Executive Council, and while we're we have some counterintuitive data, powerful best practices to share with you. The story doesn't end with coaching, however. In some recent work we've completed, we found that high performing sales managers also possessing unique ability to innovate at the deal level with the reps. If coaching is about imparting skills known to drive sales success, sales innovation is about moving individual deals forward in a purposeful manner. They're different skills, but both are hugely important in an organization seeking to make a shift to the Challenger model. In Chapter 9, we'll offer some additional words of guidance to leaders who are seeking to transform their commercial organizations into challenge organizations. If you're going to embark on this journey of building challengers, how do you design the change effort so that it leads to real long term change and not just the next flavor of the month upscaling effort? Lastly, in the afterword, we'll look at the notion of challenging beyond the world of sales. The Challenger model is one that we believe is a business concept, not just a sales concept. It's one that we've seen effectively employed in a variety of corporate settings from IT to HR to finance, legal and strategy. And we'll discuss this in more detail in the closing section of the book.\n",
      "[CATEGORY:  Challenger Narration] [SOURCEFILE:  The Challenger A new model for high performance.txt]Chapter 2. The Challenger A new model for high performance. The need to understand what your star performing groups are doing to set themselves apart from their core performing colleagues has never been more urgent. The world of sales is changing. The pre recession recipe for sales success won't get the job done in a post recession economy. That said, the economy itself serves only as a backdrop to this story. The real story revolves around the dramatic change in customer buying behaviors across the last five years that we reviewed in the previous chapter, all in response to suppliers efforts to sell larger, more complex, more disruptive. And more expensive solutions. Still, if nothing else, the global economic collapse served to throw the widening gap between core and star reps into stark contrast. Even in the depths of the downturn, when most reps were far behind quota, some reps quite inexplicably still managed not just to hit their goals, but to exceed them. What were they doing differently? Generally, the tendency in sales is to simply chalk up the difference in natural talent and assume that stars are just born with it. It's not as if you can just take their skill, bottle it, and sprinkle it over your core performers to close the gap, right? Well, what if you could? What if you could track down the replicable part of what truly sets star performers apart, capture that magic, and export it to the rest of your sales organization? Imagine a world where all of your reps, or at least many more of them, perform like stars. What would that be worth to you? What would it mean for the overall performance of your company? Well, in 2009, in a world where only the stars were selling to begin with. It could mean the difference between bankruptcy and survival. And it was in this high stakes world that we first set out to answer the question which skills, behaviors, knowledge and attitudes matter most for high performance? To figure this out, we surveyed hundreds of frontline sales managers across 90 companies around the world, asking those managers to assess 3 reps each from their teams. Two average performers and one star performer along 44 different attributes. And while the initial model was built on an analysis of the first 700 reps for whom we had data representing every major industry geography and go to market model, we've since increased that number to well over 6000 reps all over the world as we continue to run this diagnostic survey. Through our SEC Solutions Group, which is the implementation arm of the Sales Executive Council. Among other things, continuing that work has allowed us to determine whether or not the story in the data has changed over time. Especially in light of the recent slow but steady economic recovery. And for reasons we'll review momentarily, we've been able to establish quite clearly that these findings hold true irrespective of economic conditions. So what exactly was in the survey? We ask managers to assess attitudes, including the degree to which their reps seek to resolve customer issues and their willingness to seek disapproval. We asked about skills and behaviors like the reps level of business acumen and needs diagnosis ability. We looked at activities by graphs, tendency to follow the sales process and thoroughly evaluate opportunities. And finally, we asked about reps knowledge of their customers industry. As well as their own company's products. In terms of demographics, the study covered a wide range of selling models, everything from hunters to farmers, field reps to inside sales reps, key account managers to broad based account reps, as well as both direct sellers and indirect sellers. That said, we carefully control for things like Rep tenure, geography, and account size to make sure that the results apply not only universally across the entire sample, but also broadly across the wide range of companies represented in the Sales Executive Council membership. Finally. Because we were working with sales reps, we had a very practical means of measuring actual performance, namely each individual reps performance against goal. When you put it all together, what all of this work gives you is a very robust, data-driven snapshot of RAP performance that allows you to answer the question. Of all of the things that sales Rep could do well. Which ones actually matter most for sales performance? It's an extremely thorough picture of what good looks like when it comes to sales reps, skill, and behavior. We should also point out what we did not study. This work is definitively not an examination of sales Rep personality types or personal strengths. That kind of thing is hard to measure, and even harder to do anything about. If we were to tell you that charisma is hugely. This is my is hugely important to sales success. You might not disagree, but you'd likely struggle to know what to actually do with that information. Sure, over time you might find new homes for all of your non charismatic reps and hire more outgoing ones instead. But while that may in fact help performance tomorrow, it would be awfully difficult to execute practically. In order to improve performance to that. Instead, first and foremost, we want to provide advice around what you can do right now with the reps you already have. Though there are certainly a hiring story that comes out of these results as well. To that end, thinking back on the list of variables. You'll notice that all of the attributes we tested for were focused on reps demonstrated behaviors. In other words, how much more or less likely is a Rep to do X? Or how effective is a Rep at doing? Why? We did that because skills and behaviors are things you can actually do something about right away. You may or may not be charismatic, but through better coaching, for example, I can help you do a better job at following the sales process. Or through better training and tools, I can improve your product or industry knowledge. This is a survey about getting things done. It wasn't designed as much to determine why your stars are better, but rather to determine how to make your core better. Think of, look potentially huge commercial value currently locked up in the middle 60% of your sales force. What would it be worth to make each of these reps even just a little bit better? Our survey focuses on things you can do right now to help the core performers you already have act more like the stars that you wish they were. So what did we find? Which of these many attributes matters most? At the highest level, the story revolves around three key findings, each representing A radical departure from how most sales executives think about how to drive sales success. Let's take them one by 1. Finding number one, there are five types of sales reps. The first thing we did was to run a factor analysis on the data. Put simply, factor analysis is a statistical methodology for grouping a large number of variables into a smaller set of categories. Within which variables Co present and move together? For example, if we were studying ecosystems of factor, analysis of every potential ecosystem variable would tell us things like intense heat. Sand Aaron conditions scorpions and cacti tented Co present in nature. Because we tend to find them together, we could give them a category name. In other words, a desert. When we ran factor analysis on the data from our sales Rep study, we found something really intriguing. The analysis indicated very clearly that certain Rep characteristics tend to clump together. The 44 attributes we tested fell into five distinct groups, each containing a very different combination of rap characteristics. When a Rep tends to be good at 1 attribute in that group, he or she is very likely to be good at all of the others in that group as well. These groups are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Going back to the ecosystem example earlier, think of it this way. All deserts have intense heat and sand. But intense heat and sand are not unique to deserts. You find these things in other ecosystems too, maybe just in different abundance. In our study, every Rep has at least a baseline level of performance across all of the attributes we tested. For example, to 1 degree or another, all sales reps adhere to a formal sales process. All reps have at least a minimum acceptable standard of product and industry knowledge. But for almost every Rep, a specific subset of these attributes defines their primary approach to customers. We like to think of these profiles as college or university degrees. In order to graduate, every student must cover a broad core curriculum. Science, language, history, math, etc. But at the same time, university students have a primary or a major as well, the thing they specialize in, that sets them apart. And that's what these five profiles are all about. Through the five distinct majors in sales. These five profiles are not groups that we put together based on our interpretation of the data or our view of the world. We love you. Now sis. Tell the story. The five profiles are statistically derived, but they accurately and completely describe the five most common profiles found in the real world. Interestingly, they're relatively evenly distributed across our sample population. So who are these different, perhaps? As we go through the five profiles, ask yourself the following questions. Which of these five profiles do you think best describes the bulk of your Salesforce? Where have you placed your biggest bets as an organization? Or perhaps more practically speaking, which type of rapper are you trying to recruit right now? What are you trying to get your reps to behave more alike? The first profile is the hard worker. Hard workers are exactly who they sound like. These are the rats who show up early, stay late, and are always willing to put in the extra effort. Through the nose to the grindstone Cellars. They're self motivated and they don't give up easily. We'll make more calls in an hour and conduct more business in a week than just about anyone else on the team. And they're enthusiastically and frequently seek out feedback, always looking for opportunities to improve their game. A CSO with a global logistics company put it like this. These guys believe that doing the right things the right way will inevitably get you results if they do enough calls, send enough emails, and respond to enough RFP's. It'll all come together by the end of the quarter. They're the ones who are actually paying attention when we pounded the importance of the sales process. Next, we have the relationship builder. Now, just as the name implies, relationship builders are all about building and nurturing strong personal and professional relationships and advocates across the customer organization. They're very generous with their time. And work very hard to ensure that customers needs are met. Their primary posture with customers is largely one of accessibility and service. Whatever you need, they'll tell customers. I'm here to make sure that happens. Just say the word. Not surprisingly, one VP of sales we recently interviewed told us. Our customers love our relationship builders. They've worked very hard to build customer relationships, sometimes over years. It feels like that's really made a huge difference to our business. Next we have the lone wolf. The local full look familiar to anyone Sales. Lone wolves are deeply self confident and as a result they tend to follow their own instincts instead of the rules. In many ways, the lone wolves are the prima donnas of the Salesforce, the Cowboys who do things their way or not at all. Often not. They drive sales leaders crazy. They have no process compliance, no trip reports, no CRM entries. Frankly, one had themselves told us I'd fire them if I could, but I can't because they're all crushing their numbers. And that's the case for most companies. On average, global wolves tend to do very well, despite egregiously flouting the system. Because if they didn't do well, they'd probably have been fired already. Now we have the reactant problem solver. The reactive problem solvers are highly reliable and very detail oriented. While every rapid one way or another is focus on solving customer problems. These individuals are naturally drawn to ensuring that all of the promises that are inevitably made as part of the sale are actually kept once the deal is done. They tend to focus very heavily opposed dual follow-up, ensuring that service issues around implementation and execution are addressed quickly and thoroughly. One SEC member described the problem solver as a customer service Rep in sales Rep clothing. As she put it, they come into the office in the morning with grand plans to generate new sales, But as soon as an existing customer calls in with a problem, they dive right in, rather than passing down to the people we actually pay to solve those problems. They find ways to make the customer happy, but at the expense of finding ways to generate more business. Lastly, we have the challenger. Challengers of the debaters on the team. They got a deep understanding of the customer's business and they use that understanding to push the customers thinking and to teach them something new about how their company can compete more effectively. They're not afraid to share their views, even when they're different and potentially controversial. Challenges are assertive. They tend to press the customer a little, both on their thinking and around things like pricing. It has. Many sales leaders will tell you they don't reserve their Challenger Mentality for customers alone. They tend to push their own managers and senior leaders within their own organizations as well. Robin and annoying or aggressive manner, mind you. Then we'd simply call this profile the jerk, but in a way that forces people to think about complex issues from a different perspective. As one member put it. We have a handful of challengers in our company and almost all of them seem to have a standing time slot on our CSO's calendar to discuss things that they're seeing or hearing in the market. The CSO loves it. They're constantly bringing fresh insight to the table. That forces him to constantly check his strategy against reality. Finding #2. There is one clear winner and one clear loser. If you step back and think about the five profiles and ask yourself. Which would you prefer to have on your team? In many ways, they all look good. But as interesting as it is that all reps fall into one of five distinct profiles. It's really the second finding that's proven so completely surprising. When you take these vibe profiles and you compare them to actual sales performance, you find something very dramatic. One in particular performs head and shoulders above the other four. And one falls dramatically behind. Yet the results go against conventional wisdom. When most sales leaders see how each profile performs, they tell you quite frankly, they've indeed placed the biggest bet on the profile least likely to win. So who wins? Answer is the Challenger by a landslide. And comparing the five Rep profiles with actual sales performance, the first thing we did was to separate out core performers from star performers and to analyze each independently. To determine start performers, we asked participating companies to tell us which of their reps in the sample fell into the top 20% of their sales force, as measured by performance against goal. Once we have categorized all the reps in our sample by performance, we then determine the distribution of each group across the five profiles. And what we found was fascinating. First, the distribution of core performers across the five profiles is fairly even. No one profile dominates among average performing sales reps. It turns out that core performers aren't average because they gravitate to a specific profile. They're average because, well, they're average. They show up in all five categories and achieve average performance in every single one. In other words. There's not one way to be averaged, but 5. Mediocrity comes in multiple flavors. But when you look at the distribution of star performers across these same five profiles, you find something completely different. Well, there may be five ways to be averaged. There's clearly a dominant way to be a star. In that by far, is the Challenger profile, comprising nearly 40% of all high performers in our study. You'll remember the challenger Rep is the Rep who loves to debate. The one who uses his or her deep understanding of a customer's business not simply to serve them, but to teach them. To push their thinking and provide them with a new and different way to think about their business and how to compete. So what truly sets them apart? In our analysis of the 44 or so attributes we tested, six of them showed up as statistically significant in defining someone as a challenger Rep. First, the Wrap offers the customer unique perspectives. Second, the Rep has strong two way communication skills. Third. The wrap knows the individual customers value drivers. 4. The Rep can identify economic drivers of the customer's business. Yeah. The rap is comfortable discussing money. And six. The Rep can pressure the customer. At first glance, this list may seem like a strange mix of unrelated qualities. In fact, when we first put together the list of attributes we tested, it's unlikely anybody would have picked these particular six as the key components of star performance. Nonetheless, that's how the analysis came out. Each of these attributes represents a particular way in which Challenger reps significantly outperform their colleagues in the core. That said, if we group the attributes into three broader categories, we find they paint a very clear picture of who the Challenger truly is. A challenger is really defined by the ability to do three things. Teach Taylor and take control. First, with their unique perspective on the customer's business and their ability to engage in robust 2 way dialogue. Challengers are able to teach for differentiation during the sales interaction. Second, because challenges possess a superior sense of a customer's economic and value drivers, they're able to tailor for resonance, delivering the right message to the right person within the customer organization. And finally, challengers are comfortable discussing money and can, when needed, press the customer a bit. In this way, the Challenger takes control of the sale. These are the defining attributes of the Challenger, the ability to teach, tailor and take control. They're the pillars of what we've come to call the Challenger selling model. And the rest of this book will provide a road map for building these capabilities in your Salesforce. Before we turn to a closer analysis of challengers, however, let's return briefly to our overall results, because as big an AH as it has been for sales leaders around the world. That the challenger is so much more likely to win than any other profile, It's proven equally surprising, and frankly, much more troubling for sales executives to learn that the relationship builder falls so far behind. In our study, only 7% of All Star performers fell into the relationship builder profile, far fewer than any other. In. This finding should be a real red flag for all sales leaders, encouraging their refs to simply go out and. Build deeper customer relationships or, as one company told their reps in the depths of the recession, to go out and hug your customers. Now, before we go any further, we should emphasize that these results by no means suggest that customer relationships aren't important for sales. This would be a naive conclusion. Of course they are important. Particularly in complex sales where reps are required to engage in relationships with multiple stakeholders, if your customers don't know who you are, or worse, outright dislike you, you must fix that first. But at the same time, if your strategy as a sales Rep is largely one of being available to take care of whatever your customer needs, oh, acquiescing to the customers every demand. That can be a recipe for disaster in an environment where your customers are more reluctant than ever to buy your solutions, for all the reasons we discussed in the first chapter. In that environment. As critical as strong customer relationships may be. Familiarity alone isn't enough to win the business. A service oriented quarterly check in with your customer can be a great way to find business. But it's not a very good way to make business. As a result, in a world where findable business has all but vanished, relationship builders are doomed to fail. So was the Challenger profile really all that different from that of the relationship builder? It absolutely is. When you look at the attributes that define the challenger and compare them with the ones that define the relationship builder, you'll see why. Challenger reps succeed for all the reasons we just discussed. They excel at teaching, tailoring, and taking control. Meanwhile. As the challenger is focused on pushing the customer out of their comfort zone. The relationship builder is focused on being accepted into it. They focus on building strong personal relationships across the customer organization, being likeable and generous with their time. The relationship builder adopts a service mentality. While the Challenger is focused on customer value. The relationship builder is more concerned with customer convenience. The Challenger Rep wins by maintaining a certain amount of constructive tension across the sale. The relationship builder, on the other hand, strives to resolve or diffuse tension. Not to create it. It's the exact opposite approach. Granted, the conversation with the relationship builder is in many cases a very professional one. But it doesn't really help the customer make any progress against their goals. They're likable, but they're not very effective. The Challenger, by contrast, knows that there is value for both you and your customers and maintain that tension a little bit longer in the manner that pushes the customer to think differently about their own business. About the ways in which you might be able to help them to save money or make money. And ultimately about the value you provide to them as a supplier? Here's how a global head of sales in the hospitality industry put it to us when he saw these results. You know, this is really hard to look at, he said. For the last 10 years, it's been our stated strategy to hire effective relationship builders. After all we're in the hospitality business and for a while that worked fine The economy crashed. My relationship builders are completely lost. They can't sell a thing. And as I look at this, I now know why. Finding #3. Challengers are the solution selling Rep, not just the down economy Rep. The dramatic difference between challengers and all of the other reps brings us to our third and arguably most dramatic finding of all. Almost inevitably, at this point in our story, a question naturally comes up about the staying power of the challenging profile. After all, we first arrived these findings at a very specific and uniquely bad moment of economic performance. So is it possible that the superior performance of challengers is simply a temporary phenomenon? A product of the Great Recession and the brutal sales environment that it engendered. If that's the case, are we likely to come back in two or three years and find that some other profile, perhaps one as yet unidentified, is more likely to win? Based on what we're seeing in the data, we don't believe that's the case. To show you why, let's shift our perspective to the longer view for a moment and look at the Challenger findings in the context of the broader shift towards solution selling. If we look at the data through a different lens, the lens of sales complexity, we find something even more dramatic. After our initial analysis, we went back to the data and we divided up the high performers according to the complexity of the deals they were selling. Comparing star performers who sell relatively simple standalone products across a shorter sales cycle versus those who sell more complex bundles of products and solutions across a relatively longer sales cycle. In complex cells, challengers absolutely dominate, with more than 50% of All Star performers falling into this category. The only group that can even come closer? The lone wolves who most sales leaders would agree are hard to find and even harder to control. At the same time, relationship builders nearly fall off the map entirely. The likelihood that they achieve star status when you're selling complex solutions falls to nearly zero. This explains why so many organizations struggle with the migration to solutions. The world of solutions selling is almost definitionally about a disruptive sale. It's not that you're asking your customers to buy your products and put it up on the shelf with all the other products they bought. Rather, you're asking customers to change their behavior to stop acting in one way and start acting in another. To make that happen, however, you've gotta get customers to think differently about how they operate. You need to show them a new way to think about their business, and from that perspective, it's really no surprise that in this more complex world, only one profile wins, and it wins by a country mile. If you're not building or hiring challenger reps, chances are you're going to come up well short as your deals become more complex. Challengers aren't just the down economy Rep of today. Through the solution Selling Rep of tomorrow. If you're looking to grow through solutions, you're going to need challenger reps to do it. If you stop and think about your best salespeople. The one bringing in the biggest deals from the most complex customers. You can see them in this picture. Chances are, they're your best challengers. That said, implicit in these findings is a lesson for how you might think about the last, complex, more transactional parts of your business as well. In these areas, many of them in the inside are Telus sales parts of your company. It probably doesn't make sense to over invest in building challengers as the data suggests that hard workers are more likely to win the day here. If sales success is more a matter of call volume than call quality. Hard workers are primed to succeed. Challenges are critical in the complex world of solution selling, but they're not requisite for every part of the business. The overall conclusion from our research is this. If you're on the journey to more of a value based or solutions oriented sales approach, then your ability to challenge customers is absolutely vital to your sales success going forward. It's therefore imperative to understand just what exactly makes someone a challenger. After all, it's one thing to tell your reps Be a challenger. It's another thing altogether to tell them exactly what you want them to do.\n",
      "[CATEGORY:  Challenger Narration] [SOURCEFILE:  The manager and the Challenger selling model.txt]Chapter 8. The manager and the Challenger selling model. So far, we've focused on the Rep skills and organizational capabilities required to implement the Challenger selling model. But anybody who's ever attempted to execute large scale change within a sales organization will know there's one glaring omission to this story, the frontline sales manager. As a research organization devoted to improving sales performance, we've studied nearly every topic in the sales world and the message in the data is always the same. If you don't get frontline sales managers on board, the initiative will fail, whether it's changed to comp plans, the CRM system, the sales process. More basic skills and behaviors. It always comes back to the manager. The frontline sales manager and any sales organization is the fundamental link between strategy and execution. This is where change initiatives and Salesforce transformations live or die. Implementing the challenge you're selling model is no different. You cannot expect to successfully build a challenger sales organization if your frontline sales management layer is broken. It's the linchpin in terms of making the model work. While this point may be obvious to the season sales leader, what sales organizations can actually do to boost manager effectiveness is less so. While there is rather broad consensus that manager quality is the most important lever for driving Rep performance, sales leaders tend to view manager effectiveness. There's a sort of enigma. As one of our members told us, I know that manager success is crucial to my overall success. Problem is, I don't know what to do about it. And that concern is widespread, especially as sales leaders look to the future. In fact, when we asked SEC members about manager capability, A shocking 63% reported that their managers do not have the skills and competencies they need as their sales model evolves. To say nothing of the 9% of managers who don't even have the skills required to be successful in their role currently. 3/4 of our members self identify as having managers who aren't going to perform in the new environment, and that's deeply troubling. While leaders agree on the fundamental importance of the role, very few feel confident about the actual people currently occupying that role. And most are even less confident still about what to do about it. Portrait of a world class sales manager. In an effort to identify the key attributes of a world class sales manager, the skills, behaviors and attitudes that matter most for sales management excellence, we created a survey we called the Sales Leadership Diagnostic. At last count, more than 65 companies had administered this diagnostic to more than 12,000 sales reps. That we've collected data on more than 2500 individual frontline sales managers. As with any survey we conducted, the data is a strong representative sample of every major industry geography and go to market model across the Council's membership. In the survey, we asked reps to assess their managers performance across 64 different attributes of performance spanning 4 broad categories. First, we asked about management fundamentals. Things like integrity, reliability, recognition, and team building skills. These variables aren't necessarily specific to sales, but they are incredibly important, so we included them in our analysis to understand how they compare to other attributes in terms of driving manager performance. Second, we looked at attributes related to actual selling ability. Well, we don't want our manager selling for their reps. It stands to reason that they probably do need to know how to sell if they're going to help others to do it better. Here we asked about attributes like negotiation skills and whether the manager offers the customer's unique perspectives. Third, we asked about the manager's coaching skills. Do managers prepare for and customize coaching interactions? Do they follow through on their development commitments? Lastly, we looked at sales specific aspects of leadership, things like account planning, territory management and the level of innovation the manager shows and positioning offers to customers. Next, to ensure that we weren't allowing one unhappy Rep to skew our results, we excluded those managers from the analysis for whom we had data from fewer than three reps Then, to make the results manageable, we applied factor analysis to the data, boiling it down to the smallest possible number of statistically significant groups or categories. The factor analysis told us that those 64 variables fall into five distinct categories. Finally, to understand how important each category is relative to the other four, we ran a regression analysis of those factors against actual manager performance as determined by both the reps. And the companies. And that allowed us to determine of all the things a manager could be good at, which of these 64 skills and behaviors matter most for actual manager performance as assessed by the reps who observe those behaviors every single day, as well as by the companies who have a broader sense of how those managers. Maintain and grow their territories over time. Ultimately, this exercise generated the answer to the key question of manager performance. That is, the smallest number of statistically significant and distinct categories that, when combined, explain frontline sales manager excellence. To interpret what we found, let's start by separating management fundamentals like reliability, integrity and listening skills from the more sales specific drivers of manager performance. As it turns out, management fundamentals account for roughly 1/4 of sales manager success. These are the foundational skills that are necessary for success in any management job, irrespective of function. Interestingly, we also found that performance on these attributes does not fall along a spectrum, but tends to be binary. Either you're reliable or you're not, you have integrity. Or you don't. And that in turn tells us that these are inherent traits you should be looking for and the people you hire. Not skills you want to be developing in your staff overtime. Put another way, great reps don't necessarily make great managers. You can't just excel at sales To be a great sales manager, you've also got to excel at management as well. Yet that is exactly how most companies still source new frontline management talent. This approach to hiring is the root cause of many organizations high manager failure rates. Not surprisingly, our analysis of manager performance indicates that a handful of managers, roughly 4% of our sample, fail. On at least one of these management fundamentals. So one of the first recommendations we make to SC member companies completing the sales leadership diagnostic is that they find new positions for managers who fall into this 4% because we haven't even gotten to the sales specific attributes of world class managers and these people have already failed to meet the manager bar. On the other hand, while a star Rep track record is not a reliable indicator of management potential. An alternative lies in the data presented in this chapter. Armed with an understanding of the STAR Manager profile, organizations can adapt their candidate assessment protocols to look for candidates who are likely to demonstrate behaviors known to drive successful commercial outcomes, and knowing that some of these attributes are difficult, if not impossible, to develop over time. Notably, management fundamentals like integrity and reliability. These are clearly places where it makes sense to screen up front. However, traditional interview based assessment methods can be unreliable indicators of candidate potential and basic management ability. As a result, we find the progressive companies use a variety of experiential live fire assessment methods that let them see a candidate do the job before giving him the job. For example, one large high tech manufacturer uses a full day simulation based skills assessment to pre certify external candidates management capabilities before employment offers are extended. A construction material supplier uses a similar approach for internal candidates. Its pre promotion sales manager screening ensures that candidates possess and demonstrate that core combination of skills necessary to succeed as sales managers. The sale side of sales manager excellence. In the Army, there's an old saying that applies equally well to sales. No plan survives engagement with the enemy. No matter how carefully one plans for battle, running through every possible scenario of what might happen and what might go wrong, the reality on the field will inevitably be different. As a result, army leaders have adopted a style of leadership known as Commanders intent. Commanders intent is just that, a clear, concise statement of the specific goal. A commanders looking to achieve something like capture and hold that hill until reinforcements arrive. In this approach to leadership, Army leaders have stopped giving step by step instructions on how to actually go about capturing the hill because they've learned that once their troops get out in the field and engage in battle, they're going to have to quickly adapt to the situation on the ground in unanticipated ways. Not surprisingly, then, the field leaders who excel in the Army are the ones who are creative, innovative, and able to adapt to their circumstances. Typically, they're the ones who recognize possible courses of action that no one behind the front would have recognized in advance, and then guide their troops to victory through creative interpretation. Of their commanders intent. It's proven to be a powerful management philosophy that matches process on the one hand, with empowerment and innovation on the other. When victory is on the line, put the battle in the hands of your best field based leaders, the ones who identify a wide range of choices and develop an. The innovative option that specifically matches to that particular situation. As it turns out, when we studied the sales side of management excellence, the attributes that account for the remaining 3/4 of a sales manager success. We found the same thing to be true. And here is where our story shifts from preventing failure to promoting success. When we ran the analysis, we found that the attributes contributing to manager excellence fall into three high level categories and they're about what you might expect selling. Coaching. And owning. This last category is about the various aspects of business ownership that senior leaders like to see in their managers, the extent to which they run their territory as if it were their own business. So when we look at the statistically significant factors that define the sales side of sales manager excellence, the first thing we can say about this side of the manager job is that selling still matters. To be sure, these results aren't saying that your best managers spend 25% of their time selling. But they do indicate that if we were to explain what makes your best manager so much better than everyone else, roughly 25% of the reason would be because of their great selling skills. As all sales leaders know, selling skills are necessary at times, since managers are often asked to cover vacant sales territories to help close the largest sales or just to fill in for a Rep who may be on leave. But more to the point, managers are also expected to be able to model great selling behaviors for their teams. What's a specially interesting about the selling part of the story, however, is the specific attributes that rose to the top inside that category. Here we find that the same skills that matter most for manager success are the exact same sales skills we found a matter most for Rep success offers the customer unique perspectives. Tailors the offer to the needs of customers. Is comfortable discussing money. This implies that your best managers are likely going to come from your Challenger ranks, and it helps explain why top performing managers are heavily sought after for the support they can provide on the largest, most complex deals. Deals where challenger skills, as we have seen, are most needed. This brings us to the second sales specific driver of manager effectiveness, which is coaching accounting for 28% of frontline sales manager effectiveness. The size of this impact tells you what you probably expect. Coaching absolutely matters when it comes to sales management. It is a key element of manager effectiveness and, as we have long advocated to our members, a huge driver of Rep performance as well. Unlike selling, however, which is about a manager's ability to be a Rep when needed. Coaching is about the manager working side by side with reps to share his knowledge, insight and experience to diagnose and correct specific behaviors known to hinder high performance. When we look at the specific attributes of effective coaching, we find that the focus of these coaching efforts, at least for world class managers, is again the same challenger skills we saw in the selling category. Guiding reps to tailor effectively showing reps how and when to assert control. Helping reps through complex negotiations. Coaching is such an important part of the manager effectiveness story that we'll spend a good portion of this chapter discussing it. That said, it's not the whole story. While many sales leaders have come to simply equate good management with good coaching, it turns out that manager excellence is a matter of providing not just coaching, but leadership, direction and guidance. More generally, it's about demonstrating effective ownership of the business. Indeed, our analysis shows that more than 45% of sales manager excellence is a function of excelling at managing the overall business well. Great sales managers are fantastic at coaching their reps. They're even better at building their business. Great coaching is important. But it's still only part of the story. Yet if we were to have guessed. We would have said that being an effective sales leader is mostly about how one allocates resources. Things like driving process compliance, correcting actions out of step with that process, and managing resources across the territory as efficiently as possible. But it turns out that's not the case. All of these skills are captured in a category called Resource Allocation, which is just over 16% is the smallest of the four categories contributing to the sales side of Sales manager excellence. And what that tells us is that resource allocation isn't the most important part of a sales manager's job. In fact, it's the least important part of the managers job. So if sales leadership isn't about resource allocation, what is it about? Well, it turns out that sales leadership is mostly about how innovative sales managers are. Now, innovation is admittedly a loaded term that can mean many things to many people. What we're referring to here is managers collaborating with reps to understand as deeply as possible what's holding up a deal, figuring out why and where a deal is running into trouble at the customer. And then finding innovative ways to move it forward. It's important that innovation in this context. Is emphatically not about creating a new value proposition or inventing a new set of capabilities or product features. This is about creatively connecting the suppliers existing capabilities to each customer's unique environment and then presenting those capabilities to the customer. Through the specific lens of whatever customer obstacle is keeping that deal from closing. This is Commanders intent applied to the world of sales. It is about creatively modifying deal level sales strategy to adapt to the specific customer context, the reality on the ground as it were. What the sales innovation factor tells us is that star performing managers have an uncanny ability to unstick stuck deals and get them closed. Notice how different this is from coaching. Coaching is about driving performance around known behaviors. It's a perfect approach to sales management in a world characterized by a predictable path to success. Innovation, on the other hand, is about driving performance through unforeseen obstacles. It's best suited to a world of dynamic and unexpected events. In coaching, the manager already knows the answer and imparts it to the Rep. In innovation, neither the Rep nor the manager knows the answer. So instead they collaborate through the manager's leadership to discover an effective path forward. It can't coach what you don't know, but you can innovate. Arguably the biggest finding from all of our work on sales managers is just how important this innovation skill really is. At 29%, sales innovation is the single biggest sales related attribute contributing to world class sales manager performance. More important than selling skills, and much more important than a manager's ability to allocate resources. While coaching is a close second to 28%, which so interesting about sales innovation is that unlike sales coaching, which has received a huge amount of time and attention over the last five years, it isn't something that most sales leaders have really ever thought about in any systematic fashion before. Is given a blank sheet of paper and asked to list the four to five attributes that account for managers success. How many of us, unprompted, would have included anything other than selling, coaching and resource allocation on that list? And yet the data tell us that sales innovation is a distinctly important set of attributes. And there's survey responses. Reps often ranked to manage your high on coaching attributes but low on sales innovation attributes, or vice versa. The two skills moved independently of one another. Sales innovation is the missing link in terms of fully realizing the benefits of the Challenger selling model. Even armed with the best teaching pitches and honed capabilities for tailoring and taking control, even with strong sales managers who can coach these behaviors and can model the Challenger selling behaviors themselves, many deals will still not happen. While the Challenger model increases the likelihood that deals will move through the funnel, beating the status quo is a hard task. Customers are reluctant to change. The requirements for consensus continue to expand. Decision makers will continue to choose no decision, even over a good decision. This is where the innovative manager comes in. Armed with the ability to innovate at the deal level, the manager can help the Rep avoid no decision land more often than the Rep even a Challenger Rep can on her own. It's a critical capability in the battle to sell increasingly complex solutions to understandably ever more reluctant customers. For most sales leaders on a mission to improve the effectiveness of the frontline sales managers, these data reveal a huge untapped opportunity to dramatically improve sales manager performance. Because of that, we're gonna spend some time in this chapter digging into this concept of sales innovation to really understand what it is, how it works, and most important, how we can build it more systematically into our entire sales manager population. Before we get into this notion of sales innovation in more detail, however, it first makes sense to engage in a deeper discussion around sales coaching. Formalized sales coaching represents one of the biggest opportunities to improve Rep performance in a complex sales environment. But it is also one of the most misunderstood and mismanaged productivity levers. Coaching to the known. To understand why coaching is often mismanaged by sales organizations, we need to start with a definition of coaching. This is the definition of coaching that we've established with the help of a working team of members. An ongoing and dynamic series of job embedded interactions between a sales manager and a direct report designed to diagnose, correct, and reinforce behavior specific to that individual. This definition lays out the foundation of coaching and also how it differs from training. There are a few points we always emphasize with our members in terms of this definition. First, coaching is ongoing. It's continuous as opposed to a one off event or series of training events. Second, it involves diagnosis specific to the individual Rep, so coaching is customized. Whereas training typically involves A1 size fits all approach of delivering the same teaching and the same format to everyone, coaching is completely tailored to an individual reps specific needs and finally coaching is behavioral. It's not just about obtaining skill and knowledge, it's about demonstrated application of that skill and knowledge. None of this is to suggest that that training has no value. Training is good for sharing knowledge. Coaching is about acting upon it. The unique advantages of coaching stem from how it's tailored to the individual and systematically delivered at the point of need. Many organizations define coaching simply as informal training, but our research has shown that effective coaching is in fact. Very formal. It's highly structured and regularly scheduled. In the conversations we have with our members on this topic, there's another important distinction we make, which is how coaching differs from managing. While most frontline managers we speak with maintain that they do coach, for many those efforts amount to little more than managing. We tell rather than ask, We do rather than guide. The business case for coaching? One coaching finding that council is best known for shows the huge impact that affected coaching can have on a sales organization. When you improve coaching quality, the performance curve doesn't shift. It tips the middle moves, but the feet don't. What exactly does that imply? First, moving from below average to above average? Coaching appears to have little impact on our weakest performers, which seems counterintuitive. You'd imagine that these reps would be the easiest people to get a performance pop from if you could just coach them a little bit better. But the data tell us just the opposite. You can't coach away a bad fit for a job. Likewise, the shift from weak to strong coaching doesn't have much of an impact on star performers either. This finding is also a bit counterintuitive, since you'd like to think that coaching could make stars even more stellar. The analogy we use is a professional golfer. Many of them have swing coaches that they work with all the time, but in the end they're hoping to shape maybe a stroke off their average. They're already high performers. They're only looking for slight incremental improvements beyond their current level of play. But if you're a core performer, the quality of the coaching you receive has a significant impact on your performance. The data from our research suggests that the median performers on your sales force could see a performance boost of as much as 19% given a significant improvement in the coaching they receive. The impact of simply moving from the bottom third to the top third of Coaching Effectiveness would still result in a performance gain of between 6 and 8% for the core of the sales force. Not many investments can deliver that sort of productivity lift to a sales organization. This isn't just theoretical impact, it's real. We've seen this from the majority of the organizations we work with that have embarked on this coaching journey. One of our members, a major player in the insurance industry, saw results similar to what our data suggests, a 10% improvement in Rep performance for those reps who participated in the companies new coaching program versus those who didn't. Coaching matters. Formalized coaching represents a huge performance improvement opportunity in a complex sales environment. It can make the difference between hitting or missing goal for the bulk of your sales force. Our strong recommendation to our members looking to improve sales performance is to do away with coaching democratically that. Say coaching everyone equally and instead shift the majority of their coaching focus away from low and star performers and towards the core. What's more, it turns out that coaching isn't just a huge driver of sales performance. It's also a major factor in employee retention and what we call discretionary or extra effort. This was one of the bombshell findings from our original quantitative study on this topic, as it showed just how much impact coaching quality can have on employee morale. What the data tells us is this good coaches make people wanna stay. Bad coaches, on the other hand, create a fundamentally demoralizing environment. Drive people from the organization. This is true not just for our low performers, but also for our core and star performers. To cooperate this finding, we also cut the data by discretionary effort. We included a question in our survey that asked just how much effort people put into their working day in sales. Essentially what we found is that bad coaching and bad managers make people wanna give up from low performing reps to our superstars. None of them can be bothered if they don't feel they're getting affected coaching from their managers. Coaching quality absolutely matters. Give sales managers something to coach, too. When it comes to delivering quality coaching, the key lesson we've learned from several years of researching this topic is that managers can't coach effectively unless they have something to coach to. You can't just say go forth and coach. You have to make it concrete for your managers. They need to have something to coach to a clear understanding of what good looks like in your organization when it comes to sales. In other words, they need a hypothesis. While we've documented a whole range of coaching best practices, tools and templates at the council, one of the smartest tactics we've seen employed for boosting sales coaching quality came to us from one of our members in the financial services industry. They built their new coaching process directly on top of their existing. Sales process so that managers coaching efforts are directly embedded into the sales activities they're already pursuing with their sales team. If you were to look at what this company built for their sales managers, which you find is that each sales process stage has a different set of objectives. These are the behaviors critical to that stage that the company wants to reinforce. The tool also offers a number of sample questions a manager might ask to engage his reps in a coaching conversation around the objectives of that particular stage. So for example in stage one opportunity creation the manager consult this chart to verify the specific objectives and activities associated with this stage in the sales process. Things like setting and confirming a clear objective for the sales call and completing sufficient pre call research. Things your high performers are probably doing already. Then below that you find the questions the manager can use to elicit how the Rep is pursuing those objectives. For example, what is your primary objective for this call? We found that what often happens is that managers focus on outcomes rather than behaviors and coaching conversations, saying things like your conversion rate is way down. What's the problem? Aren't you following the process? That's not really what you should be after. Some members like to call that spreadsheet coaching. It's focused on business results, not behaviors, and is delivered in A1 size fits all manner. Everybody gets the exact same treatment. But done well, coaching is about behaviors, not outcomes. And that's exactly what makes this tool so effective. Even better, all of this is captured on a single page road map to a very simple tool, all on a single sheet of paper. In fact, this company sales managers carry laminated versions of this page with them everywhere they go. It's a perfect CHEAT SHEET for jumpstarting coaching conversations without requiring a bunch of procedural hoops and training and admin. In a world where most managers are at best skeptical about coaching, a tool like this goes a long way by giving managers A practical, non intrusive framework for coaching that isn't over engineered and that doesn't require them to dramatically change their behavior. On our website, the Challenger sale.com, we've provided our Manager Coaching Guide built specifically to help reinforce the Challenger selling model. This is the same tool our solutions group uses in its challenger development program. Like the sales process aligned coaching guide we just reviewed, it maps to the pillars of the model, teaching, tailoring and taking control, providing managers with guidance around what good looks like for each of these critical behaviors. As well as starter questions to facilitate coaching discussions. Help managers to pause for effective coaching. The importance of the manager, and specifically the manager's role as coach, in making the Challenger model stick is almost impossible to overstate. Given the importance of good coaching to driving behavior change of this sort, we tell our members to start from the assumption that their coaching program is probably not working as well as it should be. In our SEC Solutions group, we've worked with dozens of companies to help their sales managers improve their coaching abilities, teach deal innovation skills and otherwise raise the quality of the frontline manager core. One of the key components of our manager development program is Hypothesis Based Coaching, which we think addresses the most pervasive issue companies struggle with when it comes to coaching, getting managers to execute the double jump from product selling Rep to solution selling manager. Becoming experts in observing sales interactions as well as experts in coaching based on those interactions. Hence hypothesis based coaching. We're managers inter coaching conversations with the clear hypothesis of what good looks like. Hypothesis Based Coaching leverages a powerful framework called PAUSE. And it's something we encourage all of our members to use with their managers. Here's what Paul stands for. Preparation for the coaching conversation. Managers need to do proper and thorough preparation in advance of any coaching session. This provides continuity between coaching events and by thinking through which stage of the sales process the Rep is in. Managers can tell what behaviors are going to be critical, which is a first step to solving the observation problem of situational variation. Affirm the relationship. If the Rep isn't ready to hear the coaching and buy into the manager's role as coach, the coaching effort will be wasted. Managers need to be taught how to emphasize development by separating performance management from coaching interactions. There is always a Gray line, but it is possible to create safe situations for coaching to occur. Understand expected or observed behavior. The challenge for many managers is to understand what they're seeing and what to look for when observing their reps. If managers understand what should be happening in a meeting, it's much easier to know if it is happening. Specify behavior change. If managers know what defines critical behaviors and have an objective standard for judging those behaviors, it's very easy for them to provide specific objective feedback. This prevents coaching from being generic, subjective, ill focused, or overwhelming. Embed new behaviors. The purpose here is to move a coaching program away from being all about the coaching moment and instead making it an institutionalized process. Companies should provide tools that allow managers to create action plans for each of their reps, give continuity to managers coaching conversations, and give second line sales managers A quantitative and qualitative view into their managers coaching activities and abilities. Again, we like this framework because it surmounts some of the big obstacles to delivering coaching effectively. We also find that the notion of pause can be powerful for the manager because it suggests this idea of slowing down and thinking through the intent and purpose of the coaching interaction, as opposed to making it a check the box activity, as most time oppressed sales managers are naturally inclined to do. This approach helps ensure that one coaching conversation is a continuation of the last. It helps managers keep coaching objective and prescriptive as it focuses on documented development opportunities. Getting coaching right is hard work. But ignoring it is far more painful, especially for an organization trying to install an ambitious change like the Challenger selling model, then taking the time to make sure it's properly designed and executed. We've spent a fair amount of time talking about coaching because it absolutely is a pillar of world class sales management. However, if we go back to the results of our analysis of manager effectiveness from earlier in this chapter, one of the surprises to our members is often that the coaching bar isn't actually bigger. Before we released these results, many of our members speculated that a good 50% or more of manager excellence would be attributable to whether they provide that coaching effectively. That's not the case. It's fundamentally important, of course, But while coaching is certainly crucial for a Rep excellence, we know that there's much more to the story of manager excellence. So let's turn to the other key aspect of manager effectiveness, sales innovation. Innovating around the unknown. If sales innovation is the manager attribute that matters most, what does that mean sales manager should actually do in order to innovate? When we look at the nine attributes that rose to the top as most important in defining the sales innovation factor, which you find is that these attributes sum into three key sales innovation activities, investigate, create and share. Investigating is all about the manager's ability to determine what exactly is getting in the way of advancing a sale. Who's involved? What decision criteria will they consider? What kind of financial concerns might get in our way? The innovative manager works closely with reps to map out in as much detail as possible. The customers decision making process for any given deal, particularly one that's stalled somewhere along the line. This is important not just because most suppliers have only minimal information on how their customers make decisions, but because your customers often aren't sure themselves about how their organization makes decisions. Add to that your own efforts to sell more complex solutions to both new and existing customers, and your left facing an infinitely complex array of possible deal level obstacles. This is the battlefield where the innovative manager really thrives, collaborating with reps to creatively identify where a specific deal is bogged down. And then determining how to shake it loose. The second way innovative managers stand out is by creating solutions. We're not suggesting that you should empower frontline sales managers to cobble together new solutions or invent new services. Remember, this isn't product innovation, it's sales innovation. But that still leaves innovative managers significant latitude to innovate at the deal level. This might include repositioning the suppliers capabilities to better connect. With the customers challenges or shifting risk from the customer to the supplier in exchange for longer term contracts or access to additional cross sale opportunities. All of your managers spend a lot of time with reps working on deals, but most of that time is probably spent checking in on their work. Did you call them back? Did you send the proposal? Did you mention the optional service package? That's not solution creation, it's deal inspection and we venture to say it takes up a good 70 to 80% of the time your managers spend with their reps By contrast, innovation isn't about checking up on the Rep, it's about Co creation, thought partnership without value judgment about. We're working together collaboratively to find a better way to advance a deal. At the end of the day, you'll want your managers focusing their innovation efforts on those deals where the stakes are the highest. In other words, where their innovation time and effort is likely to pay the biggest returns. And if you think about it, we all have a few truly innovative managers. They're the ones who always find a way to get the deal done, even the ones that looked as if they had no chance at all of making it. And it's the solutions they come up with that often become the stuff of interoffice legend across the sales team. Did you hear how Bob managed to help Cindy close to Smithy? Yeah, that was brilliant. How does he come up with this stuff? One of our members called these managers sales ninjas. It's a funny term, but when you think about it, it kind of fits. These people are masters of every tool of the trade. They can find a way in when no one else can. Finally, innovative managers eagerly and actively share the fruit of their innovation efforts. There's huge value in being able to replicate the application of that innovation elsewhere if you can just capture it in ways that others can learn from. This is how you get scale from all those innovation efforts. Innovative managers are all about sharing best practices, developing and sustaining a strong relationship network inside the organization, and passing new ideas and solutions to the rest of the team. So now that we've got a better sense of what sales innovation is all about, let's go back and compare it with the other part of the ownership category of manager excellence. There are some really important implications we will discuss regarding how well resource allocation and sales innovation can peacefully coexist. Worlds and conflict. When we discussed the portrait of a world class sales manager earlier in this chapter, you'll recall that the required profile of the sales manager has really changed to become more of a leadership profile. World class managers today are defined not just by their ability to coach to the known. But by their ability to innovate around the unknown. This is critically important for an organization pursuing the Challenger model. Even with challengers armed with effective teaching pitches and the right skills to tailor and take control of the sale, overcoming the customer status quo is not going to happen 100% of the time. Many deals will still go off the rails and get bogged down. Here's where an innovative manager can make all the difference between closing a deal and charging up another loss to no decision. Unfortunately, you'll also recall that when it comes to boosting manager effectiveness, most sales leaders tend to place their biggest bet on resource allocation. That is, directing frontline sales managers to more efficiently manage their limited resources through better territory management. Deal qualification and sales process compliance. When you think about it, that's what resource allocation is all about. Efficiency. Seals innovation, on the other hand, is very much about effectiveness. Yet when you examine the impact of an efficiency focus on manager performance compared with an effectiveness focus, you find that an effectiveness focus has nearly twice the impact of an efficiency approach. Now, just to be clear, we would never say that driving process efficiency is wrong for a sales organization. But efficiency is all about doing what you already know how to do better and better. Let's get the right reps chasing the right customers engaged in the right activities. And let's do that again and again and again, if possible faster each time. But that kind of single track focus on efficiency only works if every deal is the same. If you live in a world of noble needs, findable business, and predictable customer behavior, then lock down the process and coach the heck out of it. For most sales managers, that's a pretty accurate description of their worlds five or six years ago, when straightforward product selling was still a relatively large part of their business. But that's not the world most sales leaders are living in today. If they're going to grow revenue in today's environment, driving efficiency around the known must give way, in part at least, to an ability to collaboratively innovate. Around the unknown. As one member told us, if we had religiously followed our sales process last year, our three biggest deals would have never gotten done. Sales success today is much less about getting better at what you already know and much more about creating an ability to tackle what you don't know. In order to thrive in that new world, you're going to have to build a sales organization and a sales culture that enables that kind of innovation activity. A world where effectiveness is elevated above efficiency. However, we find that most sales organizations have a long way to go on that front. In a recent survey of frontline sales managers, we asked respondents how they would characterize the current strategy of their senior leadership team based on a range of attributes and behaviors, and the answer was very clear. Most managers told us they currently operate in an environment. Dominated by a strong emphasis on efficient execution of the sales process. Meanwhile, almost no managers agreed with the statement that leadership empowers managers to set their own course of action. Yet in that same survey, managers also told us that they believe that empowerment or freedom to make decisions is in fact the most important factor for their current success. And their own study of sales manager effectiveness would suggest that they're right. Now, to be sure, every organization has to have enforceable rules. Certainly we need to set targets around specific business outcomes and push to attain them. But within that context, we still need to find a way to empower managers to pursue those ends with innovative means. Yet few companies appear to have the kind of culture in place to allow that to happen. This is the rather sobering message of this seemingly innocuous finding. At a time when sales leaders need to get back to growth, the growth engine for most organizations is built atop the wrong chassis. Your organization is designed for efficiency at a time when effectiveness is going to win the day. What the data suggests is that most organizations have a long way to go to build a culture where sales innovation can thrive. While shifting from an efficiency to an effectiveness focused sales culture is a\n",

      "The Challenger Sales Methodology emphasizes three key actions: Teach, Tailor, and Take Control, all while leveraging constructive tension. These pillars form the crux of the Challenger selling model, which has been successfully implemented in diverse industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Teach for Differentiation:**\n",
      "Challenger reps teach customers something new and valuable about their business, providing insights that help customers compete more effectively. This approach involves offering unique perspectives and engaging in two-way dialogue to reframe the customer's perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Tailor for Resonance:**\n",
      "Challenger reps tailor their messages to the specific needs, priorities, and interests of different stakeholders within the customer organization. They modify their teaching pitch based on the customer’s industry, company context, and individual stakeholder's value drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Take Control of the Sale:**\n",
      "Challenger reps assert control over the sales process, discussing pricing firmly and pressing customers to make decisions. They challenge customers' thinking and pressurize their decision-making cycles to overcome inertia and reach quicker decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model is based on the notion that while some reps may naturally be challengers, most reps can be trained to adopt Challenger behaviors, given the right tools, coaching, and recognition. It focuses on transforming both individual rep skills and overall organizational capabilities. The methodology highlights the need for teaching content to be scalable and repeatable, usually developed by marketing, and emphasizes the role of sales managers in coaching and reinforcing Challenger behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Challenger Sales Methodology is positioned as especially effective in complex sales where solution selling is critical. It was derived from research involving thousands of sales reps globally and shows that high performers often excel by challenging customers, unlike relationship builders who focus on being agreeable but perform poorly in complex sales.\n",
